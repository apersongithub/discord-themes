# discord-themes
use themes without nitro. created in javascript, someone can probably make a more efficient script
if someone made it into a chrome extension that would be great

# how to use
just copy the code from any of the files and execute it in console. Thats it!

# other stuff
feel free to change the code or whatever this basically just shows you the code for using themes just give me credit for giving u the code thats all

# INFO.js
if you unminify the code info.js will give you step by step on how the code works

# IMPORTANT
REMEMBER TO RELOAD TO USE A NEW THEME

the themes start to flicker if you click off the tab so yeah

this was created in like 3 minutes during study hall so dont give me any hate

maybe ill update in the future but someone will probally copy and make it better so yeah

you do need to execute the code in console each time but you can make a bookmarklet so you dont have to

when i update the code I may make it so you dont have to do this

you can also just use tampermonkey i think

all the scripts are minified, feel free to unminify them

# Custom backgrounds
if you know any java script you can make custom background like I did with OMOLED.js
